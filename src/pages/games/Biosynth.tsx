    "Set in a futuristic, isometric world inspired by floating mountains and vintage-modern architecture, the game follows a newcomer joining a tightly structured community. Everyone is assigned a role â€” yours is in the kitchen of a rustic tavern, where cooking becomes a daily rhythm through interactive mini-games. Outside work, the world opens up: players can explore markets, gardens, libraries, and embassies, taking on favors and quests in a society built on barter. The overarching story involves a looming threat to the land, pushing the player to build skills, form connections, and find ways to protect the fragile balance of the world.";
