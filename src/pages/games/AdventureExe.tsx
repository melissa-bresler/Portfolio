Your journey begins within an old-school display, where a terminal pops up, initiating an enthralling choose-your-own-adventure game. Navigate through the story by typing your decisions, each choice leading to new paths and outcomes. As you progress, immersive pop-ups enhance the experience: inventory windows showcase icons of collected items, and glitchy hearts on the screen reflect your dwindling health in perilous areas. Dive into a retro adventure where every decision counts and the vintage aesthetic reigns supreme.";
